    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 375°F.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground venison or wild boar meat until fully cooked, stirring occasionally. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the meat from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same skillet, add the sliced mushrooms and chopped wild garlic or ramps.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sauté until the mushrooms are tender and any excess liquid has evaporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chopped wild greens to the skillet and sauté for an additional 2-3 minutes, until wilted. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble the lasagna, spoon a layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add a layer of no-boil lasagna noodles or cooked wild rice on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles or rice, followed by half of the cooked meat and mushroom mixture. Repeat with another layer of marinara sauce, noodles or rice, ricotta mixture, and meat and mushroom mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top the lasagna with shredded mozzarella cheese and sprinkle with the wild berries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30-35 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
